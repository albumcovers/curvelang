All of the names of the elements are coherent with HTML.
You cannot use `<link>`, `<br>`, or `<hr>` yet.

In your directory, 
create this file structure:
```
|── my-crv-app
    |── config.yaml
    |── app.crv
```

`config.yaml` is your project configuration. 
Here's an example:

```yaml
project:
  # The name of your project will go here.
  title: "Example Curve Project"
```

Then your `app.crv` file is your editable code.
